# Medical-Need-analysis-Using-ML-algorithms

The purpose of this project is to analyse the impact of the ageing population on healthcare expenditure based on the given dataset. The project involves data analytics techniques to derive insights and provide recommendations based on the analysis. The project includes several steps, including data exploration and cleaning, descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, time series analysis, and comparative analysis and plus use of Other Machine learning algorithms like XG BOOST,DECISION TREE it over all gave us an accuracy of 87%

Data Exploration and Cleaning:
•	Explore the dataset and understand the variables and their meanings.
•	Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
•	Clean the data by addressing any issues identified, such as imputing missing values or removing outliers.
•	For this We used the given xls file to csv and then used pandas framework in python to explore and filter all unwanted data in it


Descriptive Analysis:
•	Explore the dataset and understand the variables and their meanings.
•	Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
•	Clean the data by addressing any issues identified, such as imputing missing values or removing outliers.
•	And Used data visualization packages like sea born matplotlib to explore the current trends in the ageing population Here are the list of findings
•	And used statistical analysis to gain mathematical insights of the given data set Like mean,median and standard deviation etc 
 Mean Age: 8.793969849246231
Median Age: 9.0
Standard Deviation of Age: 2.6558043578104793
