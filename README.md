# Medical-Need-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the impact of the aging population on healthcare expenditure based on the given dataset. Utilizing advanced data analytics techniques, this analysis aims to uncover key insights and trends that can inform strategic decision-making and policy recommendations.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this analysis is named "Dataset Task02 .csv" and contains various medical features, including the target variable "HeartDiseaseorAttack".

## Data Preprocessing
### Data Loading and Initial Inspection:
The dataset is loaded using pandas.
Initial inspections are performed to understand its structure and identify any missing values.

### Handling Missing Values:
Missing values are identified and appropriately handled to ensure a clean dataset for analysis.

### Feature Scaling:
Feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler to standardize the features, improving the performance of machine learning algorithms.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Box Plot:
A box plot is created to visualize the distribution of the features in the dataset.

### Summary Statistics:
Summary statistics of the dataset are computed to provide an overview of the data.

### Age Distribution:
The distribution of the 'Age' feature is visualized using a histogram, and key statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) are computed.

### Correlation Heatmap:
A correlation heatmap is created to visualize the relationships between features.

## Model Building and Evaluation
### Data Preparation:
The dataset is split into features (X) and target (y), and then further split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

### Model Training and Evaluation:
### Random Forest Classifier:
A Random Forest classifier is trained and evaluated.
Achieved an accuracy of 87.5%.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM):
An SVM classifier is trained and evaluated.
Achieved an accuracy of 87.5%.

### Gradient Boosting Classifier:
A Gradient Boosting classifier is trained and evaluated.
Achieved an accuracy of 87.5%.

### Model Comparison
A bar chart is created to compare the accuracies of the different models.

### Feature Importance
The importance of features in the Random Forest model is visualized to identify the most significant features contributing to the predictions.

### Results
Random Forest Accuracy: 0.875
SVM Accuracy: 0.875
Gradient Boosting Accuracy: 0.875.
All models achieved an accuracy of 87.5% on the test data. Feature importance analysis revealed the most significant features contributing to the predictions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning models to predict heart disease or heart attacks based on medical data. The models showed similar performance, and feature importance analysis provided insights into the key factors influencing the predictions. The analysis offers valuable insights into the impact of the aging population on healthcare expenditure, guiding strategic decision-making and policy recommendations.
